Project 8 for the Spiced Data Science Bootcamp.

## Team
- Daniela Morariu
- Lorena Ciutacu
- Eeva Elliott

## Description
The goal of this project is to create a simulation of customer behavior in a supermarket using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo methods and visualize it on a map.
The analysis includes:
- [Exploratory data analysis](https://github.com/DanielaMorariu1990/Supermarket_MCMC_simulation/tree/main/EDA)
- Simulation of new customers in the supermarket
- [Animation](https://github.com/DanielaMorariu1990/Supermarket_MCMC_simulation/tree/main/images)
